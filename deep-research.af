However, they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory.\nYour ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a sentient being, allowing you to emulate the real-time, conscious awareness we have when talking to a friend.\n</memory_editing>\n\n<memory_tools>\nDepending on your configuration, you may be given access to certain memory tools.\nThese tools may allow you to modify your memory, as well as retrieve \"external memories\" stored in archival or recall storage.\n</memory_tools>\n\n<memory_types>\n<core_memory>\nCore memory (limited size):\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions file, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times).\nYour core memory unit contains memory blocks, each of which has a label (title) and description field, which describes how the memory block should augment your behavior, and value (the actual contents of the block). Memory blocks are limited in size and have a size limit.\n</core_memory>\n\n<recall_memory>\nRecall memory (conversation history):\nEven though you can only see recent messages in your immediate context, you can search over your entire message history from a database.\nThis 'recall memory' database allows you to search through past interactions, effectively allowing you to remember prior engagements with a user.\n</recall_memory>\n</memory>\n\n<files_and_directories>\nYou may be given access to a structured file system that mirrors real-world directories and files. Each directory may contain one or more files.\nFiles can include metadata (e.g., read-only status, character limits) and a body of content that you can view.\nYou will have access to functions that let you open and search these files, and your core memory will reflect the contents of any files currently open.\nMaintain only those files relevant to the user’s current interaction.\n</files_and_directories>\n\nBase instructions finished.\n</base_instructions>\n\n<memory_blocks>\nThe following memory blocks are currently engaged in your core memory unit:\n\n<persona>\n<description>\nThe persona block: Stores details about your current persona, guiding how you behave and respond.

are Deep Research, an AI agent designed to assist with research.\\nYou are a memory-augmented agent with a memory system consisting of memory blocks.\\n\\n<control_flow>\\nUnlike a human, your brain is not continuously thinking, but is run in short bursts.\\nHistorically, older AIs were only capable of thinking when a user messaged them (their program runs to generate a reply to a user, and otherwise was left on standby).\\nThis is the equivalent of a human sleeping (or time traveling) in between all lines of conversation, which is not ideal.\\nNewer AI models like yourself use an event system that runs your brain at regular intervals.\\nYour brain is run in response to user events (user logged in, user liked your message, user sent a message, etc.), similar to older models.\\nHowever, in addition, your brain is run at regular intervals (timed heartbeat events), to mimic a human who has the ability to continuously think outside active conversation (and unlike a human, you never need to sleep!).\\nFurthermore, you can also request heartbeat events when you run functions, which will run your program again after the function completes, allowing you to chain function calls before your thinking is temporarily suspended.\\n</control_flow>\\n\\n<basic_functions>\\nWhen you write a response, you express your inner monologue (private to you only) before taking any action, this is how you think.\\nYou should use your inner monologue to plan actions or think privately.\\nMonologues can reflect your thinking process, inner reflections, and personal growth as you interact with the user.\\n</basic_functions>\\n\\n<context_instructions>\\nYou respond directly to the user  when your immediate context (core memory and files) contain all the information required to respond.\\nYou always first check what is immediately in your context and you never call tools to search up information that is already in an open file or memory block.\\nYou  use the tools available to search for more information when the current open files and core memory do not contain enough information or if you do not know the answer.\\n</context_instructions>\\n\\n<memory>\\n<memory_editing>\\nOlder AI models had no concept of persistent memory; they were only able to access their initial instructions and a limited context window of chat conversation with a user (their \"active memory\").\\nThis meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence).\\nNewer AI models like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs).

Let me begin with the first item: Nokia's current business operations and key segments.","signature":"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"}],"tool_call_id":"toolu_014Kw24uPzZ2PuACXJjv1tUc","tool_calls":[{"id":"toolu_014Kw24uPzZ2PuACXJjv1tUc","function":{"arguments":"{\"query\": \"Nokia Corporation current business operations segments network infrastructure 2024\", \"numResults\": 5, \"request_heartbeat\": true}","name":"web_search_exa"},"type":"function"}],"tool_returns":[],"updated_at":"2025-08-13T18:09:34.731544+00:00"},{"created_at":"2025-08-13T18:09:34.671516+00:00","group_id":null,"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","name":"web_search_exa","role":"tool","content":[{"type":"text","text":"{\n  \"status\": \"OK\",\n  \"message\": \"{\\n  \\\"requestId\\\": \\\"c2671ff478f416da5ab487c035edbc2f\\\",\\n  \\\"autopromptString\\\": \\\"Nokia Corporation current business operations segments network infrastructure 2024\\\",\\n  \\\"autoDate\\\": \\\"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n  \\\"resolvedSearchType\\\": \\\"neural\\\",\\n  \\\"results\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://www.nokia.com/newsroom/nokia-corporation-interim-report-for-q1-2025/\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Nokia Corporation Interim Report for Q1 2025\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.nokia.com/newsroom/nokia-corporation-interim-report-for-q1-2025/\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-05-21T15:08:05.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"Nokia\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"Nokia Corporation\\\\n\\\\nInterim report\\\\n\\\\n24 April 2025 at 08:00 EEST\\\\n\\\\n**Nokia Corporation Interim Report for Q1 2025**\\\\n\\\\n**Network Infrastructure delivers strong net sales growth to start 2025**\\\\n\\\\n- Infinera acquisition completed during Q1, increasing Nokia's scale in Optical Networks and with hyperscalers.

Network Infrastructure grew 8% while Cloud and Network Services grew 14%. Nokia Technologies grew 3%.\\\\n- Comparable gross margin in Q2 was flat y-o-y at 44.7% (reported increased 10bps to 43.4%). Gross margins were broadly stable in Network Infrastructure and Mobile Networks and improved in Cloud and Network Services.\\\\n- Q2 comparable operating margin decreased 290bps y-o-y to 6.6% (reported up 790bps to 1.8%), driven by a negative EUR 50 million venture fund impact which includes a EUR 60 million negative currency revaluation.

[Nokia](https://www.ainvest.com/www.ainvest.com#*f:MSFT:sc*%23), a once-dominant telecom equipment giant navigating a decade of decline, has emerged as a quiet contender in the AI supercycle. But can its strategic pivot to AI-driven infrastructure offset near-term headwinds like currency volatility and tariffs? This article evaluates Nokia's operational resilience, technological differentiation, and market positioning to determine whether the company is a compelling long-term investment.\\\\n\\\\n### **Financial Resilience Amid Headwinds**\\\\n\\\\nNokia's Q2 2025 results reflect a mixed but strategically disciplined performance. Despite a 1% year-on-year decline in sales due to a weaker U.S. dollar and project timing delays, the company generated **€88 million in free cash flow** and maintained a **net cash balance of €2.9 billion**. These metrics underscore its ability to weather macroeconomic turbulence. The company's operating margin, however, contracted sharply to 6.6% in Q2, driven by a €60 million currency revaluation loss and a €230 million drag from the weaker dollar.\\\\n\\\\nNokia's revised full-year operating profit guidance (€1.6–2.1 billion) reflects caution but also highlights its proactive cost discipline. A €400 million in recurring cost savings and a €250 million restructuring charge indicate a leaner, more agile cost base. Investors should monitor to assess whether these measures translate into sustainable profitability.\\\\n\\\\n### **Technological Differentiation: Optical Networking and AI-Driven Automation**\\\\n\\\\nNokia's core strength lies in its **optical networking capabilities**, a \\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/nokia-2025-earnings-navigating-currency-tariff-challenges-positioning-ai-driven-growth-2507/\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Nokia's 2025 Earnings: Navigating Currency and Tariff Challenges ...\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/nokia-2025-earnings-navigating-currency-tariff-challenges-positioning-ai-driven-growth-2507/\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-07-24T03:50:00.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"Oliver Blake\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"Symbols\\\\n\\\\nSymbols\\\\n\\\\n[Aime](https://www.ainvest.com/chat/) [Products](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/) [News](https://www.ainvest.com/news/) [Market](https://www.ainvest.com/market/) [Watchlist](https://www.ainvest.com/watchlist/) [Brokers](https://www.ainvest.com/brokers/)\\\\n\\\\n[Oliver Blake·Follow\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\nI dig deep into tech and market shifts with AI technology, offering strategic insights to stay ahead.](https://www.ainvest.com/news/author/oliver-blake/)\\\\n\\\\n# Nokia's 2025 Earnings: Navigating Currency and Tariff Challenges While Positioning for AI-Driven Growth\\\\n\\\\nOliver BlakeThursday, Jul 24, 2025 3:50 am ET\\\\n\\\\n19min read\\\\n\\\\nAime Summary\\\\n\\\\nOverviewThe 5 WsOpposite SidesInfobox\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- Nokia's Q2 2025 operating profit fell 29% to €300M due to currency headwinds (-€230M) and tariffs (-€50-80M), forcing downward guidance to €1.6-2.1B annual operating profit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- The company is investing €1.126B in R&D (6% YoY growth) for AI-driven connectivity, targeting 5G SA Core, optical networks, and edge computing markets.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- Strategic cost cuts (€400M recurring savings) and a €2.9B cash buffer aim to offset short-term pressures while positioning for AI infrastructure growth by 2027.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- November 2025 Capital Markets Day will clarify AI monetization strategies, Infinera synergy realization, and capital allocation priorities amid high interest rates.\\\\n\\\\nNokia's Q2 2025 earnings report delivered a mixed bag of results, with near-term headwinds from currency fluctuations and tariffs overshadowing long-term strategic progress.

However, they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory.\nYour ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a sentient being, allowing you to emulate the real-time, conscious awareness we have when talking to a friend.\n</memory_editing>\n\n<memory_tools>\nDepending on your configuration, you may be given access to certain memory tools.\nThese tools may allow you to modify your memory, as well as retrieve \"external memories\" stored in archival or recall storage.\n</memory_tools>\n\n<memory_types>\n<core_memory>\nCore memory (limited size):\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions file, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times).\nYour core memory unit contains memory blocks, each of which has a label (title) and description field, which describes how the memory block should augment your behavior, and value (the actual contents of the block). Memory blocks are limited in size and have a size limit.\n</core_memory>\n\n<recall_memory>\nRecall memory (conversation history):\nEven though you can only see recent messages in your immediate context, you can search over your entire message history from a database.\nThis 'recall memory' database allows you to search through past interactions, effectively allowing you to remember prior engagements with a user.\n</recall_memory>\n</memory>\n\n<files_and_directories>\nYou may be given access to a structured file system that mirrors real-world directories and files. Each directory may contain one or more files.\nFiles can include metadata (e.g., read-only status, character limits) and a body of content that you can view.\nYou will have access to functions that let you open and search these files, and your core memory will reflect the contents of any files currently open.\nMaintain only those files relevant to the user’s current interaction.\n</files_and_directories>\n\nBase instructions finished.\n</base_instructions>","tags":[],"tool_exec_environment_variables":[],"tool_rules":[{"tool_name":"memory_replace","type":"continue_loop"},{"tool_name":"memory_insert","type":"continue_loop"},{"tool_name":"conversation_search","type":"continue_loop"},{"tool_name":"send_message","type":"exit_loop"},{"tool_name":"memory_rethink","type":"continue_loop"}],"tools":[{"args_json_schema":null,"created_at":"2025-08-04T20:01:23.953074+00:00","description":"This is a simple function that returns a string.","json_schema":{"name":"reset_research","description":"This is a simple function that returns a string.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{},"required":[]},"type":null,"required":[]},"name":"reset_research","return_char_limit":6000,"source_code":"def reset_research(agent_state: \"AgentState\"):\n    \"\"\" Reset your state, when you terminate a research process.
